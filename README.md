# Titanic EDA Project

## 📚 Project Description

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival rates. The analysis focuses on different factors such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and port of embarkation.

The project uses Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, statistical exploration, and creating meaningful visualizations.

## 📈 Key Steps Performed

* Loaded and inspected the Titanic dataset.
* Handled missing data in the `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin` columns.
* Created a new feature `Has_Cabin` to indicate whether cabin information is available.
* **Univariate Analysis**: Explored individual features such as Survival, Sex, Age, Fare.
* **Bivariate Analysis**: Examined relationships between features and survival rates.
* Created visualizations including count plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
* Summarized key findings about factors influencing survival.

## 📋 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
4. To generate a PDF, export the notebook using the PDF export option.

## 🚀 Summary of Findings

* Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
* First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to second- and third-class passengers.
* Younger passengers, especially children, had better chances of survival.
* Higher ticket fares and boarding from Cherbourg (`C`) were associated with higher survival rates.
